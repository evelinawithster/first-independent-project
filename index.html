            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a recovering architect who is currently working in the construction
                 project management field. Working remotely is aligned with my life style.
                  I enjoy learning new skills and always wanted to learn how to code. 
                  Finally the opportunity to do so presented itself for the first time and I decided to give it a try.
